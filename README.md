## Presentation
### Objectives
The main objective is to use the algorithmic and programming tools treated in the lectures and tutorial courses in a real graph.

The specific objectives of the project are:
- Initiate the students to the manipulation of graph data, from the data collection to thegraph construction
- Implement algorithms studied in the lectures and tutorial courses for the calculation of shortest paths in real data.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to calculate the diameter of the Parisian subway graph. The shortest paths should be calculated in two types of graphs:
- Unweighted graph
- Weighted graph

Finally, graph clustering should be implemented. To this end, we will identify the edges with the highest "betweenness" in order to remove them and to reveal the underlying clusters. Once the clusters are identified, they shall be interpreted.
